# Hedera: A Personal Assistant Chatbot

Hedera is my first attempt at an AI chatbot. I used this [tutorial](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/ai-chatbot) as a reference and will update this file with any subsequent references I use.

Hedera was first ideated as a bot companion in my personal Discord server, where it would be able to record to-do lists, schedule server events, send reminders to refocus and  of upcoming deadlines, and essentially act as a second entity that I could brainstorm with and receive encouragement from.

## Future plans
In this first iteration, I plan to develop Hedera as a web app to gain experience with web frameworks and deployment, then later add functionality as a Discord bot.

## Method

## Origin of Name
Many of my social media handles and usernames when I was younger were a single name, ivythe1st. I used the name Ivy as I saw it as a 'Western alternative' to my real name, Iman, and I wanted a 'normal' name that would obscure my cultural identity and let me fit in with the North American culture around me. 
I've since grown to proudly embrace my real name and my home culture, but I still think the name Ivy is important to me. I wanted to create a chatbot assistant that would be personalized to me and my day-to-day requirements, but I didn't want a name as on the nose as Ivy, so I used the genus name of most ivy plants, Hedera. So in a way, you can view it as a service that utilizes my past identities to help support the individual I am today.

Thank you for visiting my repository, and I hope you'll learn as much as I have along this development journey.
